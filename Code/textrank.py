In the second set, Anderson was broken twice by the Spaniard, but in the third and final set, the South African's serve was not broken. The relaunched and compressed Davis Cup organisers reportedly gave Roger Federer three days to decide whether or not to participate in the contentious event. The majority of Davenport's success occurred in the late 1990s, and her third and final major championship victory occurred at the 2000 Australian Open. In the redesigned competition, Argentina and Britain will compete alongside the four semifinalists from 2018 and the 12 teams that advance from the qualifying rounds in February. """
