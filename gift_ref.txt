The keen hearing sense stood out above all else. I adored the elderly man. He had never insulted me. I had no desire to possess his gold. He had a pale blue eye like that of a vulture that was covered with a film. Madmen are ignorant. After creating a space large enough for my head, I inserted a black lantern that was completely sealed so that no light could escape, and then I pushed in my head. Every morning as the sun came up, I entered the room fearlessly and spoke bravely to him, addressing him by name in a rousing voice and asking how he had spent the previous night. I remained silent and stood still.I suddenly heard a faint groan, and I immediately recognised it as the groan of fatal fear. —it was the deep, muffled sound that, when supercharged with wonder, emerges from the depths of the soul. My hatred was raised since a soldier's courage is boosted by the sound of a drum. It intensified moment by moment, becoming louder and louder. But the beating became increasingly louder! I believed that my heart would break. The action had been completed, so I grinned broadly. It eventually stopped. I took the bed off and looked at the body. As the night became darker, I laboured quickly but silently. Nothing needed to be cleaned up, including no stains of any kind or blood stains of any kind.All had been captured in a tub, ha! There was a knock on the street door as the hour bell rang. I welcomed the gentlemen. I said that I had made the yell while dreaming. I indicated that the elderly man wasn't in the countryside. I commanded them to thoroughly search. Finally, I took them to his chamber. They were persuaded by my demeanour. As the ringing intensified, — I spoke more freely in an effort to get rid of the sensation, but the noise persisted and got more apparent until, at last, I realised that it was outside of my ears. It was similar to the sound a watch makes when it is wrapped in cotton: low, dull, and rapid.
